## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Black (#000000) to convey sophistication and exclusivity, in dark mode.
- Text color: White (#FFFFFF) for readability against the dark background.
- Accent color: Intense Gold gradient to highlight key elements and CTAs with elegance.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', serif, for an elegant, fashionable, high-end feel, paired with 'PT Sans' sans-serif for body.
- Employ a minimalist layout with a focus on white space to enhance the sense of sophistication and premium quality.
- Incorporate subtle 'liquid glass' effects for a modern, high-end feel. The liquid glass effects should be subtle and not distract from the content.
- Use clean, minimalistic icons that reflect medical and esthetic themes with a touch of elegance. Keep the number of icons small for a premium design.
